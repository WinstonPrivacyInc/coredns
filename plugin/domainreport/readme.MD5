# Winston Domain Reporting service

This plugin reports every domain that was queried back to a websocket listener running on the Winston firmware.
The firmware uses this to modify the underlying iptables rules to intercept suspicious or blocked domains.

Example:

```
    ws://localhost:8897
    {"host": "microsoft.com"}
```

1. Modify Corefile with the following stanza

```
domainreport {
     port :8897
}
```
