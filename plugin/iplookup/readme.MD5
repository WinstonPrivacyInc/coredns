# Reverse lookup service

1. Modify Corefile with the following stanza

```
iplookup {
     listen :8053
     entries 1000
     duration 30m
     global true
}
```

entries and duration are mutually exclusive. You can add both but only one will be used.

2. Resolve IP addresses to their corresponding origin host queries via the following URL. If the hostname
was recently queried, it will show up here.

```
http://localhost:8053/172.217.4.202
```
